A jekyll-reveal.js presentation starter kit

Copy from `https://github.com/tamouse/jekyll-reveal.js-presentation-starter-kit`.

Initialize the git repo:

    git init
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Modify `_config.yml` and `_config_publish.yml` as needed.

Modify `_data/links.yml` and any other data files as needed.

Create your slides in `_slides`, slides will appear in lexicographical order. Use numerical prefixes to put them in a specific order, such as `00-01-welcome.md`, `01-01-hour2.md`.

Read the reveal.js at <http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/> and <https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/>

Remember you can mix HTML into Markdown easily. The Kramdown processor also lets you put Markdown inside HTML blocks.

Local styles and overrides are in `css/slide-styles.css`.
