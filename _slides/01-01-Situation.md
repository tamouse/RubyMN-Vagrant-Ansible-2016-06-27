## The Situation

* We already used Vagrant extensively in our project dewelopment
* I had written a Vagrant + Ansible starter kit and had been using it for setting up dev environments at work, which got some interest
* We were starting a set of new Rails-backed projects with various clients
* We wanted to use a more streamlined and modern approach to bootstrapping, provisioning, and deployment
* Ansible is pretty easy to learn
