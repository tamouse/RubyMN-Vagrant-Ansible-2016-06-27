## The Situation

* I had written a Vagrant + Ansible starter kit I had been using for setting up dev environments that got some interest
* We were launching a set of new Rails-backed sites, with separate API-driven front ends (using React.JS mostly)
* We wanted to use a more streamlined and modern approach to bootstrapping, provisioning, and deployment
