## What is Ansible

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is really a collection of DevOps tools.

* It lets you bootstrap, provision, and configure hardware (inventory).
* You can using for deploying applications (in place of using capistrano, for example).
* Lots of pre-existing modules, plugins, and an API.
* Highly extensible

### And what separates it from the others:

* Configuration is in simple, plain text files (ini and yaml).
