## Second Approach: Thor Generator

Seeing the ridiculousness of our ways and the wisdom in our fumbling, I wrote up a Thor Generator

* Specify destination, i.e. run anywhere
* Site Template: Ansible config, Vagrantfile, provisioning elements
* Rails Template: bring in all standard project gems, configuration settings, initialize the app
* Initialize project specifics, variables, etc.
