## Changing Provisioning

* As we went along on the various projects, we found we needed different, additional packages

* We also learned better ways to set up some of the existing packages and configurations

* Installing additional playbooks, tasks, etc., only required re-provisioning the VM:

<pre><code class="bash">vagrant provision</code></pre>

* This saved us tons of time, and kept our downstream provisioning and deployments clean as well
